```

2. Generate access token on the platform `API settings -> Create new token`
3. Login with the tool using token you generated `vidoc-importer login --token TOKEN`
4. Import private programs from h1: `vidoc-importer import hackerone-private --session-cookie (cookie __Host-session z hackerone)`
5. You can also import ALL public programs from all of the platforms (h1, bugcrowd, intigriti, yeswehackâ€¦) using command `vidoc-importer import all-public`
